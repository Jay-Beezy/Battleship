Team 5 Project 2 Estimated Total Hours: 27.5
*Estimation derived through Agile user story method, with Project 1 used as our inventory of products. We think Project 1 was equivalent to 8 story points and we estimate project 2 to be equivalent to 5 story points. Because Project 1 took 43.5 hours to complete, Project 2 has a 27.5 hour estimate*
